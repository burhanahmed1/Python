## Strings

This folder contains various tasks related to string manipulation in Python. You'll find exercises on slicing, concatenation, formatting, and more.

## Lists & Tuples

In the Lists & Tuples folder, I've tackled exercises involving list and tuple operations. Tasks include indexing, slicing, sorting, and using list comprehensions.

## Dictionaries & Sets

Explore tasks related to dictionaries and sets in this folder. Exercises cover key-value pair operations, set operations, and common methods used with these data structures.

## If-Else Conditions

This section contains practice tasks that focus on conditional statements. You'll find exercises on using if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of your programs.

## Loops

The Loops folder includes tasks that involve different types of loops in Python, such as for loops and while loops. Exercises help understand iteration and looping through various data structures.

## Functions & Recursion

Here, I've solved tasks related to defining and using functions, as well as implementing recursive solutions. Exercises include parameter passing, return values, and recursive problem-solving techniques.

## File I/O

This folder contains tasks related to file input and output operations. Exercises cover reading from and writing to files, handling different file types, and managing file exceptions.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In the OOP folder, you'll find exercises that deal with the principles of object-oriented programming. Tasks include creating classes & objects, defining methods. Inheritence, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Encapsulation.
